# ITforBusinessDataAnalytics

This repository contains coursework from my IT for Business Data Analytics Master's degree.

## Contents

### Assignments
1. **Assignment 1**: Deep Learning
   - Notebook: [DeepLearning.ipynb](assignments/DeepLearning.ipynb)
   - Description: This project involves classifying companies from the Forbes Global dataset into two categories based on their market value. The goal is to preprocess the data, create binary labels, train a deep learning model, optimize its performance, and evaluate the results.

2. **Assignment 2**: Non Neural Machine Learning
   - Notebook: [Non_NeuralMachineLearning.ipynb](assignments/Non_NeuralMachineLearning.ipynb)
   - Description: This project focuses on preparing, exploring, and building machine learning models to classify arm gestures using smartwatch sensor data. The main goals are to preprocess the data, fine-tune the models, and evaluate their performance using both quantitative and qualitative methods.
