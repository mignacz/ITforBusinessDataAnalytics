This repository contains coursework from my IT for Business Data Analytics Master's degree.

## Contents

### Assignments
1. **Assignment 1**: Deep Learning
   - Notebook: [DeepLearning.ipynb](assignments/DeepLearning.ipynb)
   - Description: The project involves classifying companies from the Forbes Global dataset into two categories based on their market value. The goal is to preprocess the data, create binary labels, train a deep learning model, optimize its performance, and evaluate the results.

2. **Assignment 2**: Non Neural Machine Learning
   - Notebook: [Non_NeuralMachineLearning.ipynb](assignments/Non_NeuralMachineLearning.ipynb)
   - Description: This project focuses on preparing, exploring, and building machine learning models to classify arm gestures using smartwatch sensor data. The main goals are to preprocess the data, fine-tune the models, and evaluate their performance using both quantitative and qualitative methods.

3. **Capstone Project**: 
   - Notebook: [mignaczCapstoneProject.ipynb](assignments/mignaczCapstoneProject.ipynb)
   - Description: The capstone project focuses on predicting click-through rates (CTR) on advertisements using machine learning models. The goal is to analyze how various features influence user interactions with ads. The primary objective is to identify the features most impactful on CTR and optimize ad placements and formats accordingly.
